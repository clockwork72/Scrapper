What information do we collect?
### 
Highlights
The information that we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?annotations\[0\]=0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis). For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you ask [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai) to write a joke for you. When you use our products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?annotations\[0\]=1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf).
Here's the information we collect:
[Your activity and information that you provide](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?subpage=1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation)

What if the information that we collect doesn't identify individuals?
In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated or anonymised by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it's made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.

### 
Highlights
We use [information that we collect](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalised experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes that we explain in detail below.

But in some cases, we also use [manual review](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?annotations\[0\]=2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) to access and review your information.
To use less information that's connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymise it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.
